# “The problem is not the problem. The problem is your attitude about the problem. Do you understand?” – Jack Sparrow

This code prints the name of the current captain (now it is Hector's name).

However, the crew re-elected the captain, and now it's Jack Sparrow.

Fix the declaration of captain variable and redirect it from Hector Barbossa to Jack Sparrow by creating a new Pirate object by analogy. After that, print the name of the current captain again.

Sample Output:

Hector Barbossa

Jack Sparrow
